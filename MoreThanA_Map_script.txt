5. [ ] Change the Mark Type to "Shape" and select a square
6. [ ] Deselect the "Add to Zoom Extend" option


## Session 2:  Hawaii
###1. Create the Lava Flow Datasource
1. [ ] Connect > Spatial file > data/Lava Flows data
2. [ ] Select the KIL_2018_LERZ_FlowChrologyPolys.shp file (in the "Part2 - Lava flow in Hawaii" folder on the VM desktop) - then go to "Sheet 1" tab
3. [ ] Rename "Geometry" to "Lava Flow"
4. [ ] Change "FlowTime1" from "String" to "Date and Time"
5. [ ] Create a calculated Field called "Lava Area" Area(Lava Flow, 'km')

###2. Plot the Lava
1. [ ] Drag or double-click "Lava Flow" to map
2. [ ] Bring "FlowTime1" to "Detail" and select "Exact Date" for temporal selection
3. [ ] Bring "Lava Area" to "Detail" 
4. [ ] On the map, Hover over "Lava Flow" and see what happens
5. [ ] Experiment with putting things on Color...  "Lava Area", "FlowTime1" (look at the various time levels.)

###3. Watch the Flow
1. [ ] Drag "FlowTime1" to "Pages" and select "Exact Date" for temporal selection
2. [ ] On the menu bar (on top), Format››Animations and turn them to "OFF" for the workbook

8. [ ] close the dialog box and got to Sheet 2

###6. Plot Structures

3. [ ] Under BigIslandHawaii.csv you'll see "ID",  Put that on "Detail" on the marks card
4. [ ] On the "Structures" Marks card, Switch from "Automatic" to "Circle"

###7. Bring all Structures 
1. [ ] go back to the data join and switch from "Left" to "Full" join

4. [ ] Put "In Lava?" on color and see what happens.


###8. Find the Roads damaged
1. [ ] Repeat the steps for joining sturctures to the Lava but this time for "Roads" ("3. Roads" subfolder)
